        <p>I started at <i>Sofology</i> in 2018.</p>

        <p>I began as a webchat agent dealing with various different queries in regards to sofa sizes, styles, colours and so on.
            I really enjoyed my job, however it soon became more Sales based. (Which I am terrible at!) This prompted me to broaden
            my horizons and really think about the career path I wanted to go down. I've been in Customer Services all my life so 
            a change was definitely needed! 
        </p>

        <p>Sofology began to offer Junior Developer Apprenticeships, with no experience and a pocket full of hope, I decided to apply. 
          2 Group exercises later and a nerve-wracking week of waiting, I found out that I had the role!
        </p>

        <p> Now, here I am, currently on an intense Bootcamp with the help of <i>CodeNation</i>! Living my best life! I can't wait to hone
        and develop my skills further with other developers out there.</p>
